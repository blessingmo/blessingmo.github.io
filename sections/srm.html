										<h2>SRM Unit 1-4</h2>
									</header>
									<ul>

						<li>For Units 1-4, we were introduced to risk identification, classification, analysis, mitigation, quantitative vs qualitative, 
							data gathering, information Security Management System (ISMS), risk calculation, threat modeling, threat modeling manifesto 
							(which I for the first time came across), and several threat modeling models. Units 1-3 were linked by Collaborative Learning Discussion(1). 
							We were given a case study(Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) to answer some questions in the discussion forum. 
							In my collaborative discussion, I summarised that many of the opportunities of Industry 4.0 are linked with several cyber risks. 
							To further identify security risks, industry 4.0 organisations can choose two or more threat modelling systems (e.g. STRIDE and OWASP) 
							to decompose attacks into fundamental elements and plan responses to perceived threats. I also stated that Deloitte's paper on Managing 
							Risk in Digital Transformation (2018) supports the Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019 study while speaking directly to an established Digital transformation.
							Adam Shostack's (2014) book 'Threat Modeling: Designing for Security' was generally an enjoyable read. 
							I have previously read most of the chapters. This was a reinforcement learning process making the chapters more understandable. 
							Also, the threat modeling cookbook introduced in Unit 4 was resourceful with rich information in the GitHub repository.</li>

						<li>Units 5 and 6 focused on exploring the cybersecurity industry-specific security standards and directives and how standards affect security and risk assessments, 
							common industry and enterprise standards. This unit defined several terms, discussed organisational measures, policies and procedures, access control and password management,
							introduced Business Continuity and touched upon standards like the Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT), 
							Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles.</li>

								<li>This assessment and exercise introduced the practical application of the risk models, methodology and standards. Qualitative risk assessment was used in identifying risks and threats for Pampered Pets. 
								Some of the frameworks considered were the NIST 800-181 BIA Framework,  ISO 27001 and PCI DSS</li>

								<h2>SRM Units 7 - 9</h2>
								
							</header>
								<ul>

						<li>Units 7, 8 and 9 delve into quantitative risk modelling (QRM),  including Monte Carlo Simulations, Bayes theoretical models and QRM techniques. The units progressed to business continuity (BC)
							and disaster recovery (DR) plans, Business Impact Assessments (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and emerging trends in information security risks. 
							Another collaborative discussion was introduced in unit 7, stirring up the conversation around the criticism of the Common Vulnerability Security Score (CVSS). 
							We read ‘Time to Change the CVSS? by Spring et al. (2021), a literature that raised critical concerns regarding the CVSS. The authors mentioned that ‘The Way Forward’ 
							is to have a new algorithm to address the various risk elements of context and material consequences (environmental scores, operational scoring problems, and material consequences). 
							I beleieve that a mix and match of these scoring systems can also be a better approach.</li>

								<h2>SRM Units 10 - 11</h2>
								
							</header>
								<ul>

						<li>Units 10 and 11 touched heavily upon Disaster Recovery, advantages and disadvantages of DRaaS, challenges with vendor lock-in, 
							resilience, network security and emerging trends in Security Risk Management. In our final seminar discussion tagged The Great; 
							The Future of Security Risk Management.	In a presentation, I discussed the Current Threat Landscape (CTL) 
							with heavy consideration on digitlisation. The risks associated with ML and AI,  advancing human-machine interfaces, cyber-physical systems, 
							cloud computing, authentication tools, sensors, advanced analytics capabilities, and digital customer profiling. 
							This seminar was thought-provoking and resulted in a debate between groups, though we had time constraints, and thus a lot was left unsaid. 
							These units provided insights into the methodology, context, and outcomes highlighting the advantages of various risk models, frameworks, differences between 
							qualitative and quantitative risk analysis, the need for risk assessment, the value of involving users in SRM and aligning security with business goals </li>

						<li>I coordinated the team meetings, created meeting sessions, took notes, created a group contract, created the Monte Carlo Simulation for Unit 11 assignment using Jupyter Notebook 
							via Codio and prepared the team’s final reports. I have had the opportunity to work on BIA, DRP, and BCP and simulated a Disaster Recovery exercise at work, and was 
							therefore able to use my real-life experience where necessary during the assessments.</li>
